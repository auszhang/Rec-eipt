# Rec-eipt

## About

Rec-eipt is a web app that splits a receipt for you. Just upload a picture! No more pulling out your phone and calcuating tip, tax, and how to split among your friends when our app does it for you.

Rec-eipt is built with Python and the Flask framework, using Google Cloud Platform for its image analysis.

## For the future

Possible ideas for future development post-hackathon, in no particular order:

* Rebuild frontend using React
* Make the web app more robust so it can handle less ideal images (ripped or folded receipts, crooked photos). 
* Rebuild as a mobile application, so that instead of uploading a picture, users could just take one on their phones.

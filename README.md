# Rec-eipt

Rec-eipt (pronounced Split Receipt) is an app that takes in a bill and splits it! No more pulling out your phone and calcuating tip, tax, and how to split among your friends when our app does it for you.

Rec-eipt is built with Python and the Flask framework, using Google Cloud Platform for its image analysis.
